# MatrixViewer
Large and complicated matrices can be challenging to understand and visualize. Utilising Jupyter Notebooks, DataShader, HoloViews, and 
Bokeh, the size of Matrix that can be viewed in MatrixViewer is only really limited by the amount of memory available. Plots are dynaically updated when zooming in on features, and properties 
of the data are dynamically aggregated allowing for quick detection of features such as extreme values and strong connections.
